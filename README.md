The next logical course after this one is cs50w (CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript)

# Cs50x_practice_22
Practice code for cs50 course 2022
This is a follow-up from the previous 2021 course I was working through. I decided to move forward to the 2022 course to keep my learning up to date. Simple as that. 
Incidentaly, one thing that was mentioned early on in the 2022 course was about scope when it comes to while and for loops which was an ulrika moment for me. 

One other thing I would like to mention is error management. I want to spend more time logging errors and use it as a reference point when things go wrong in the future.
