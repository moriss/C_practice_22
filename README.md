Currenly you are using the files as follows:
Planning.c is your starting point after making notes in introduction.c. Its a file to organise your mind in taking the right approach to planning code for a specific task. It also encourages you to try writig code in different ways that procuce the same result. 
Currenly these involve using the three types of loops for, while and do while (which have their own files).
It's important you save the code into the relevant 'loop' file and also copy paste error messages into errors.c (with fixes).

introductions gives  initial info for new items you are learning. They could well brach out into their own file if required. Move to planning.c after making notes in this file to better understand and expand on the item being taught.

arrays_1 is an example of an item spilling over from introduction into its own file.



Below may be relevant but is older.

You are working on # Cs50x_practice_22
NB: The next logical course after this one is cs50w (CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript)

My Update on 11th April 2023
I have added a '0.12_the_Guide' file to help me focus as I work through the course. I think I previously created too many short files so I've decided to migrate content from these short files over to this new file. I can also reference larger files here where necessary. 

If you have been away from this for a while, it's best to read through the '0.12_the_Guide'  you created here and make sure you understand the content before continuing with the next part of the course. The 0.12_the_Guide file will show a list of contents at the top for quick reference and also where in the course you are at. 



# Cs50x_practice_22
Practice code for cs50 course 2022
This is a follow-up from the previous 2021 course I was working through. I decided to move forward to the 2022 course to keep my learning up to date. Simple as that. 
Incidentaly, one thing that was mentioned early on in the 2022 course was about scope when it comes to while and for loops which was an ulrika moment for me. 

One other thing I would like to mention is error management. I want to spend more time logging errors and use it as a reference point when things go wrong in the future.
